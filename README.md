Welcome to the DEKI technical test.

Start with : `yarn` or `npm i` in `client/` and `server/` to install dependencies.

To launch the client : `yarn start` or `npm start`
To start the server: `yarn dev` or `npm dev`

You need to create a route that returns the user list and then display it in the client as a list using Ant Design.

If you have some time left, you can create 2 other routes, one to receive a user and the other to modify user information.


You get 3 - 4 hours to do the test. A clean code will be appreciated.
